Write the queries from point 1 and 2 in a file called creates.sql

Write the queries from point 3 in a file called inserts.sql

4. Answer the following question
Which are the Tag(s) for a given Article_13

Write the queries from points 4 in a file called selects1.sql

5. Export the Data Base to SQL or CSV

6. Execute the following migration
Separate Category on two tables
Category_part1 containing created_by
Category_part2 containing all the other fields
As a result SQL queries+code in other programming language must be create.

7. Export the Data Base to SQL or CSV

8. Answer the following question
Which are the User(s) for a given Category
As a result SQL query must be created
Write the queries from points 8 in a file called selects2.sql

9. Draw a picture of the database

Create a zip from this folder and name the zip FirstName_LastName_Class_Number.zip
(here FirstName is your first name, LastName is your last name, class is A or B and Number is your number in class)

Good luck and may the force be with you!
