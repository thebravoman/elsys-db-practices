User_part1 containing picture_url
User_part2 containing all the other fields

Write the queries from points 8 in a file called selects2.sql

9. Draw a picture of the database

(here FirstName is your first name, LastName is your last name, class is A or B and Number is your number in class)

Good luck and may the force be with you!
