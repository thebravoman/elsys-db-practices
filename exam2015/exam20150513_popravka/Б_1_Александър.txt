Write the queries from point 3 in a file called inserts.sql

5. Export the Data Base to SQL or CSV

6. Execute the following migration

User_part1 containing created_on
User_part2 containing all the other fields
As a result SQL queries+code in other programming language must be create.

As a result SQL query must be created
Write the queries from points 8 in a file called selects2.sql

9. Draw a picture of the database

(here FirstName is your first name, LastName is your last name, class is A or B and Number is your number in class)

Good luck and may the force be with you!
